# go-task
This MATLAB script presents an experimental task where participants are shown a series of visual stimuli in the form of colored circles. Participants are required to respond to specific stimuli by pressing a key. The script has potential integration points with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) devices by triggering of a parallel port.
